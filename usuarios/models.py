class Usuario(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):

    Custom User model for the medical prescription application.

    This model extends Django's `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`
    to provide a custom user authentication system. It uses email as the
    primary authentication field and includes additional flags to identify
    user roles (e.g., doctor, clinic).

    Security: Email-based authentication provides better user experience
    and reduces username enumeration attacks compared to username-based systems.

    Critique:
    - The `is_medico` and `is_clinica` fields are boolean flags. While functional,
      for more complex role management, a dedicated `Role` model with a ManyToMany
      relationship to `Usuario` might be more scalable and flexible. However,
      for simple doctor/clinic distinctions, this approach is acceptable.
    - The `USERNAME_FIELD` is set to `email`, which is a good practice for modern
      applications.
    - It uses a `CustomUserManager`, which is necessary for custom user models.

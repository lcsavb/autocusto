## 🏥 MEDICAL SAFETY FEATURES (Critical)

### ✅ Medication Validation System
**Status: DEPLOYED & CI/CD TESTED**

Critical safety system preventing invalid medical prescriptions:

**Components:**
- ✅ **Backend validation** (`forms.py`) - Prevents server-side submission
- ✅ **Frontend validation** (`med.js`) - Immediate user feedback  
- ✅ **Form handler integration** - Seamless UX with progress indication
- ✅ **Node.js unit tests** - 20+ comprehensive test scenarios
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** - Deployment blocked if medication logic fails

**Safety Guarantees:**
- 🚫 **Cannot submit** prescriptions with all medications = "nenhum"
- ✅ **Must have** at least one valid medication selected
- 🔄 **Double validation** - Client-side + server-side protection
- 🧪 **Regression prevention** - Automated testing prevents safety bugs

**Files involved:**
- `processos/forms.py` - Backend validation logic
- `static/autocusto/js/med.js` - Frontend validation
- `static/autocusto/js/form-handler.js` - Form integration
- `static/autocusto/js/tests/medication-validation.test.js` - Test suite

## 🔧 DATA-DRIVEN PDF ARCHITECTURE

### ✅ Unified PDF Generation System
**Status: DEPLOYED - Replaces Legacy Hardcoded System**

The legacy hardcoded disease system has been replaced with a flexible, database-driven approach:

**Problems Solved:**
- ❌ ~~Two parallel PDF systems~~ → ✅ Single unified GeradorPDF
- ❌ ~~Hardcoded disease classes~~ → ✅ Data-driven strategy pattern
- ❌ ~~Giant switch statements~~ → ✅ Database configuration
- ❌ ~~Unmaintainable scaling~~ → ✅ Add diseases via database, not code

**Current Architecture:**
```
Single GeradorPDF
├── Universal PDFs (main generator)
│   ├── Base LME form (always)
│   ├── Consent PDF (if primeira_vez = True)
│   ├── Report PDF (if relatorio = True)
│   └── Exam PDF (if exames = True)
└── Data-Driven Strategy (disease/medication specific)
    ├── Disease files: ["pdfs_base/edss.pdf", "pdfs_base/lanns.pdf"]
    └── Medication files: ["fingolimod_monitoring.pdf"]
```

**Database Configuration Example (Protocolo.dados_condicionais):**
```json
{
  "fields": [
    {"name": "opt_edss", "type": "choice", "choices": ["0", "1", "2"]}
  ],
  "disease_files": ["pdfs_base/edss.pdf"],
  "medications": {
    "fingolimode": ["fingolimod_monitoring.pdf"],
    "natalizumabe": ["natalizumab_specific.pdf"]
  }
}
```

**Migration Status:**
- ✅ **Multiple Sclerosis** - Fully migrated with EDSS + medication configs
- ✅ **Chronic Pain** - LANNS + EVA + medication configs  
- ✅ **Epilepsy** - Medication-only configuration
- 🔄 **Other diseases** - Gradual migration in progress

## 💾 AUTOMATED GPG BACKUP SYSTEM

### ✅ Production-Ready Backup Infrastructure
**Status: DEPLOYED - Military-Grade Encryption**

Fully automated, production-ready backup system with comprehensive security:

**Architecture:**
```
VPS Host (Daily 2:00 AM)
├── Docker Container
│   ├── python manage.py dbbackup → /var/backups/autocusto/file.psql.bin
│   └── (2:15 AM) python manage.py upload_backup
│       ├── GPG encrypt → file.psql.bin.gpg
│       ├── Upload to Nextcloud → backups/file.psql.bin.gpg  
│       └── Delete local .gpg file
├── Local Storage (7-day retention)
│   └── /var/backups/autocusto/*.psql.bin
└── Nextcloud Storage (permanent)
    └── backups/*.psql.bin.gpg (encrypted)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automated daily backups with GPG encryption (4096-bit keys)
- ✅ Nextcloud WebDAV upload for offsite storage
- ✅ Django cron job integration
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- ✅ Local and remote retention policies
- ✅ Health check scripts and failure notifications

**Components:**

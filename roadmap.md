Phase 1: Project Archaeology & Revival

  Phase 2: Analysis & Core Logic Lockdown
  Now you can start understanding the code and building your testing safety net.

   1. Dependency Audit: Analyze requirements.txt for outdated or insecure packages. Plan a strategy for upgrading them incrementally.
   2. Backend Testing (Your Idea): Start writing tests for the most critical and complex parts of the backend first. Based on your project structure, this seems to
      be:
       * The PDF generation logic in processos/manejo_pdfs.py and logica_raw/.
       * The business logic within the models.py and views.py of the processos, pacientes, and medicos apps.
   3. Refactor with Coverage: With tests in place, you can now refactor the code you've identified as "inexperienced" with confidence.

  Phase 3: Frontend Untangling
  You mentioned the frontend is complex. Let's figure out what we're dealing with.

   1. Tech Stack Identification: Determine exactly what the frontend is built with. Is it vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, or something else? I'll investigate the
      template files (.html) and static assets.
   2. Frontend Testing Strategy: Based on the technology, we can devise a testing plan. For older jQuery-based frontends, this might involve tools like Jest with
      jsdom. For vanilla JS, we can use similar tools.
   3. Modernization (Optional but Recommended): Consider if the frontend complexity warrants a gradual migration to a more modern library or framework (like HTMX
      for enhancing server-rendered templates, or Vue/React for more complex interactivity).

  Phase 4: Finishing the Project
  With a stable, tested, and understood codebase, you can now define what "finished" means.

   1. Feature Roadmap: Create a clear list of remaining features or bug fixes.
   2. CI/CD: Implement a simple Continuous Integration pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically run your tests and linters on every push.

  This roadmap provides a structured path from a dormant project to a maintainable and complete application.

  To begin, let's start with Phase 1, Step 1. I will inspect your requirements.txt to see what dependencies we're working with.

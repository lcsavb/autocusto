# Comprehensive Security Audit Report
**AutoCusto Medical Application**  
**Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Auditor:** Claude AI Security Analysis  
**Application Type:** Django Medical Prescription System  

---

## üî¥ Executive Summary

This Django medical application manages sensitive patient data and prescription generation for the Brazilian healthcare system (SUS). While the application implements several security measures, **critical vulnerabilities** exist that require immediate attention before production deployment with sensitive medical data.

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Immediate action required  
**Compliance:** LGPD (Brazilian Data Protection Law) compliance needed  

---
### 4. **Weak Random Number Generation**
**Risk Level:** üü† **HIGH**  
**File:** `processos/manejo_pdfs.py:89`

```python
aleatorio = str(random.randint(0, 10000000000)) + dados_finais["cns_medico"]
```

**Issues:**
- Predictable random numbers for PDF filenames
- CNS medical ID included in filename (data leakage)
- Potential enumeration of medical documents

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to medical records via filename guessing  
**Fix:** Use cryptographically secure random generation

---

### 6. **Weak Authentication & Authorization**
**Risk Level:** üü† **HIGH**  
**Files:** Various view files

**Issues:**
- Simple boolean role system (`is_medico`, `is_clinica`)
- No granular permissions for medical operations
- Session-based authorization without proper validation
- No protection against privilege escalation

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to patient data, prescription fraud  
**Fix:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## üü° Medium Priority Security Issues


### 8. **Session Management Weaknesses**
**Risk Level:** üü° **MEDIUM**

**Issues:**
- No session timeout configuration
- No protection against session fixation
- Session data used for authorization decisions

**Fix:** Implement proper session management

### 9. **Third-Party Dependency Risks**
**Risk Level:** üü° **MEDIUM**  
**File:** `requirements.txt`

```
pypdftk==0.5                # External binary dependency
selenium==4.18.1           # Testing dependency in production
whitenoise==5.0.1           # Older version
```

**Issues:**
- External binary dependency (`pdftk`) increases attack surface
- Testing dependencies in production build
- Some dependencies may have known vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Likelihood | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Hardcoded Credentials | üî¥ Critical | High | Critical | **Immediate** |
| Production Debug Logs | üî¥ Critical | High | High | **Immediate** |
| File Access Control | üü† High | Medium | Critical | **Week 1** |
| Weak Random Generation | üü† High | Medium | High | **Week 1** |
| Input Validation | üü† High | High | Medium | **Week 2** |

| Dependency Risks | üü° Medium | Low | Medium | **Month 1** |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Plan

### **Phase 1: Critical Issues (Immediate - 48 hours)**

1. **Remove Production Debug Logging**
   ```python
   # Remove from settings.py
   if not DEBUG:
       # DELETE ALL DEBUG PRINT STATEMENTS
   ```

2. **Secure Hardcoded Credentials**
   ```python
   # settings.py - Remove fallback values
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_USER']  # No fallback
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD']  # No fallback
   ```

3. **Fix PDF Access Control**
   ```python
   @login_required
   def serve_pdf(request, filename):
       # Verify user owns this PDF before serving
       if not user_owns_pdf(request.user, filename):
           raise Http404("Not found")
   ```

### **Phase 2: High Priority (Week 1)**

1. **Implement Secure Random Generation**
   ```python
   import secrets
   aleatorio = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)  # Cryptographically secure
   ```

2. **Add Comprehensive Input Validation**
   ```python
   from django.core.validators import RegexValidator
   # Add validation to all form fields
   ```

3. **Implement Role-Based Access Control**
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
   @permission_required('processos.view_patient_data')
   ```

### **Phase 3: Medium Priority (Month 1)**

1. **Session Security Enhancement**
   ```python
   SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 3600  # 1 hour timeout
   SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True
   ```

2. **Audit Logging Implementation**
   ```python
   import logging
   security_logger = logging.getLogger('security')
   # Log all sensitive operations
   ```

3. **Dependency Security Review**
   ```bash
   pip audit  # Check for known vulnerabilities
   ```

1. **Remove production debug logging** from `settings.py`
2. **Secure all hardcoded credentials**
3. **Implement PDF access authorization**
4. **Review and test all fixes**

**This application handles sensitive medical data and must not be deployed to production until critical security vulnerabilities are addressed.**

---

## üìù Conclusion

The AutoCusto medical application has a solid foundation with proper use of Django's security features, but **critical vulnerabilities exist** that pose significant risks to patient data privacy and system security.

**Priority:** Immediate remediation of critical issues before any production deployment with real patient data.

**Next Steps:** 
1. Implement Phase 1 fixes immediately
2. Conduct security testing
3. Proceed with Phase 2 and 3 improvements
4. Regular security reviews and updates

**Compliance Note:** Additional work needed for full LGPD compliance in medical data handling.
